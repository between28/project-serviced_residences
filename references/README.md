# References Folder Policy

This folder stores local reference materials for reading and annotation.

- PDF source files under `references/` are intentionally ignored by git.
- Keep only lightweight metadata or index notes here if needed.
- If a specific file must be versioned, place it outside `references/` or update `.gitignore` with an explicit exception.
