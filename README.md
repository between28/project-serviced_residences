# Project: Serviced Residences Dissertation

This repository supports the University of Cambridge MPhil dissertation:
"When Accommodation Becomes Housing: Regulatory Arbitrage and Housing Supply Substitution in South Korea".

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: proposal, research design, policy codebook, and governance notes
- `paper/`: dissertation manuscript workspace (chapters, appendix, bibliography)
- `src/`: reusable analysis code modules by pipeline stage
- `scripts/`: executable entry points that run stages in order
- `data/`: raw/interim/processed data staging
- `outputs/`: reproducible tables, figures, and model artifacts
- `notebooks/`: exploratory and robustness notebooks
- `references/`: local reference library metadata (PDFs untracked)

## Working Rules
- Canonical dissertation documents are in `docs/dissertation/`.
- Root markdown files are lightweight entry points for editor convenience.
- Keep large raw data and local PDFs out of Git.
