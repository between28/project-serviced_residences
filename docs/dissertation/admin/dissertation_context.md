# Dissertation Context and Standards

## Programme Context
- Programme: University of Cambridge, MPhil in Planning, Growth and Regeneration
- Dissertation topic: regulatory arbitrage and housing supply substitution in South Korea
- Working date baseline: February 17, 2026

## Core Quality Standards
- Clarity: explicit research questions, assumptions, and identification logic
- Reproducibility: script-first workflow, deterministic data pipelines, documented variable construction
- Transparency: policy coding rules and event definitions must be versioned
- Robustness: pre-specified sensitivity checks and policy-family separation

## Governance Rules
- Use absolute dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in policy/event files
- Keep raw source files out of Git unless they are very small metadata files
- Keep local reference PDFs untracked

## Dissertation Delivery Artifacts
- Proposal and detailed design note
- Policy event codebook and timelines
- Data dictionary and panel construction documentation
- Main model outputs and robustness appendix
