# Identification Strategy (Working Note)

## Unit of Analysis
- Permit: `sigungu-month`
- Start/completion: `building-month`

## Fixed Effects
- Region FE (`sigungu`)
- Calendar month FE

## Policy Design
- Separate housing policy events from serviced-residence policy events.
- Use lead/lag event windows for dynamic effects.
- Keep composite intensity specifications in robustness only.
